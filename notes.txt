Fine tunning LLM models 

1. Quantization

-- full precision / half precision
-- calibration
-- modes of Quantization

Quantization : conversion from higher memory format to lower memory format.

FP 32 bits - stored in floating points (full precision) (values stored in memory)

we make this 32 bit to lower memory like int 8 and then download the moddel to use otherwise it will 
take large amount of space.

How to perform Quantization:

-- symmetric / -- asymmetric
